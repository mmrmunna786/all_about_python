Write a function called find_greater_numbers which accepts a list and returns the number of times a 
number is followed by a larger number across the entire list. 

Take the example find_greater_numbers([6,1,2,7]) # 4 , there are 4 times where a number is followed 
by a greater number:  
    2 > 1
    7 > 6
    7 > 1
    7 > 2 

For example:
find_greater_numbers([1,2,3]) # 3 
find_greater_numbers([6,1,2,7]) # 4
find_greater_numbers([5,4,3,2,1]) # 0
find_greater_numbers([]) # 0

def find_greater_numbers(arr):
    count = 0
    i = 0
    j = 1
    while i < len(arr):
        while j < len(arr):
            if arr[j] > arr[i]:
                count += 1
            j+=1
        j = i+1
        i+=1
    return count

print(find_greater_numbers([1,2,3])) # 3 
print(find_greater_numbers([6,1,2,7])) # 4
print(find_greater_numbers([5,4,3,2,1])) # 0
print(find_greater_numbers([])) # 0
